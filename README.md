# Headline scraper

A simple in-house scraper to list the blog headlines from:

`https://leastauthority.com/blog/`

How to use:

* download the `headlines.html` file and open it in your browser. (right-click and choose "Open With" and the name of your browser)

* * [Go to CORS anywhere]('https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/') and allow it, if need be

CAUTION: 

* the number of pages is hardcoded at "10", since that's the current number of pages on the Least Authority Blog page
 
* there is no stylesheet, so yay old school vibes

* it's vanilla JS, no libraries
